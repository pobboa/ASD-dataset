ASD: This dataset contains 1,200 pairs of spatially registered section views, generated by sectioning 15 groups of diverse indoor scenes along the X, Y, and Z axes. It features
five common furniture categories: bed, stool, table, nightstand, and wardrobe. We split the dataset into training and
validation sets with an 8:2 ratio. Figure 7 demonstrates how
we obtain sections along the X-axis, Y-axis, and Z-axis of
the models, with the two rightmost columns presenting the
recognition results produced by our network.
